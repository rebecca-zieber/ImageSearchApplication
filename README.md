# ImageSearchApplication
This is my final project for a class I took on programming mobile devices. I only want to take credit for the image download functionality. The rest of this project was provided by the YouTube channel CodingInFlow. 
The purpose of this project was to give me a second look at all of the concepts we'd studied over the quarter, but using Kotlin instead of Java.
